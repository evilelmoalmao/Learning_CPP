Okay, since nobodies actually gonna see this, rant timeee

I feel like a cuck. Milla's constantly fucking hugging Amber right infront of me, and i just feel so 
fucking jealous everytime. I know it makes her happy, but it makes me so fucking jealous.

She hugs Amber longer, tighter, and she's constantly following her around. It's like she's turning her
into her new partner. And it feels like she's just disregarding me so much, giving an occasional side hug.

The blatant cuddling on the chair had me fucking seething, cause i was literally just sitting in a chair
infront of them. I was literally in a fucking cuck chair.

A fucking side hug. Why can't i get the heart warming, long hugs, huh? Am I just not good enough? Would
you prefer me to be a girl? 

Going back to Milla, she's been worrying about me a bit. 

Does she really love me, or does she just want attention from me
